# Vagrant for ns-3.27

This is a Vagrantfile for generating ns-3.26 environment on Ubuntu 16.04.

## Requirement

Install VirtualBox and Vagrant on a host computer.

## Special thanks

The Vagrantfile is based on [diogomg/vagrant-ns-3-setup](https://github.com/diogomg/vagrant-ns-3-setup). I modified some lines to adapt the file to ns-3.27.
